# hello-world
First repository
Hello everyone,

This is my first GitHub repository. I'll be using GitHub to keep up my development skills so that I can keep pace with the software world, in which software dev skills is becoming more and more critical to my career. My role is not strictly technical, I'm a business and people manager, however I am in Cloud and I have built and managed an API Practice for a large Australian telecommunications company. As part of that I've been surrounded by brilliant technically minded people, which has helped me overcome my technical weakness as I concentrate on the business side of things. Even as a business leader you need to understand the concepts, the challenges and the benefits - you cannot do this properly without understanding the technology somewhat. That's what I'm here to do - learn the concepts.

The last time I did any software development was in 2000 where I worked with Visual Basic and Delphi 4. I've also had some experience with Java, JavaScript and C++, but only in an academic setting. I'm hoping that some of that teaching comes back to me as I learn.

Although I'm at a very early stage of learning, you have to start somewhere.

Thanks for reading.

David
